#### speedie's stupid fetch for macOS/Mac OS X and Linux

Was bored so I decided to write a fetch tool! 

## It currently fetches:
- Your distro
- Your kernel and version
- Your shell (zsh, bash, fish, etc.)
- Your package count (GNU/Linux)
- Your Mac (macOS/Mac OS X)

## And has ASCII art for:
- Gentoo Linux
- Funtoo Linux
- Arch Linux
- Fedora Linux
- Debian Linux
- Manjaro Linux
- Project 081 (Mac OS X distro)
- Mac OS X
- macOS
- PearOS (Garbage)
- Cutefish OS (Garbage)
- Linux/Other Distro (used if your OS is none of the above)

## Use:
1. cd /usr/bin
2. sudo/doas wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speediegamer/sfetch/main/sfetch
3. sudo/doas chmod +x /usr/bin/sfetch
4. Run sfetch

## Note:
- macOS/Mac OS X support has not been tested (Although feel free to test it for me!)
- Has only been tested with Linux
- Has been tested with both zsh and Bash but feel free to try other shells
