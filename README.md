# sfetch
#### speedie's fetch for macOS/Mac OS X and GNU/Linux.

## NOTE
sfetch is pretty poorly written and has a lot of bash-isms.
I will likely be rewriting this fetch soon. Consider saving your PRs until then :)

Was bored so I decided to write a fetch tool! 

## It currently fetches:
- Your distro
- Your kernel and version
- Your shell (zsh, bash, fish, etc.)
- Your package count (Linux)
- Your Mac (macOS/Mac OS X)

## And has ASCII art for:
- Gentoo Linux
- Funtoo Linux
- Arch Linux
- Fedora Linux
- Debian Linux
- Manjaro Linux
- Project 081 (Mac OS X distro)
- Mac OS X
- macOS
- Niresh and other distros (Trash)
- PearOS (Trash)
- Cutefish OS (Trash)
- Linux/Other Distro (used if your OS is none of the above)

## Usage on most GNU/Linux distros
    curl -o /usr/local/bin/sfetch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speediegq/sfetch/main/sfetch
    chmod +x /usr/local/bin/sfetch

## Usage on macOS
    curl -o /usr/local/bin/sfetch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speediegq/sfetch/main/sfetch
    chmod +x /usr/local/bin/sfetch

## Note
- Has been tested with both zsh and Bash but feel free to try other shells
- I will not be providing any support for GNU-less operating systems. Consider creating a PR if you have a fix though.
